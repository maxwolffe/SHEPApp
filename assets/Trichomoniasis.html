          <p>Trichomoniasis, or 'trich', is a very common STI, infecting 7 million people in the U.S. each year. Trich is caused by the single-celled protozoan parasite, Trichomonas vaginalis.</p>

<strong>Transmission</strong>
          
<p>Trich is transmitted through penis-vagina or vulva-vulva intercourse, or any activity which might transfer infected fluids from one partner to another. Rarely, it can be transmitted through objects like towels, sheets, and underwear. </p>

<strong>Symptoms</strong>
<p>
Most people, ~ 70%, do not experience symptoms of trich.  Trich also does not usually cause complications. When symptoms are present, they appear 5-28 days after exposure, but some people get symptoms up to a few months following exposure.
</p>

<p>Females may experience vaginal discharge, vaginal odor, vaginal itching, swelling in the groin area, pain during intercourse, frequent urination, or pain or burning sensation during urination.

</p>

<p>Males (if symptoms are present) may experience irritation inside the penis, mild discharge, or burning sensation during urination or ejaculation. </p>

<strong>Complications</strong>
<p>Without treatment, chlamydia can lead to serious complications. For females, these include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) which can lead to infertility, cystitis (bladder infection), and mucopurulent cervicitis. For males, complications include prostatitis (inflamed prostate), scarring of the urethra, infertility, and epididymitis (inflamed epididymis).</p>

<strong>Diagnosis</strong>
<p>Diagnosis for trich usually involves a culture to collect samples followed by a lab test. It is harder to diagnose in males than in females. Before this culture, females should ensure that they are not menstruating, and not put anything in the vagina for 24 hours in advance (e.g. sex, douching).
</p>

<strong>Treatment</strong>
<p>Trich can be cured with medication. All partners should be tested, and treated if appropriate. The patient should avoid sex until all medication has been completed. </p>

<strong>Prevention</strong>
<p>The following strategies can help reduce the risk of infection:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Abstinence</li>
   <li>Mutual monogamy</li>
   <li>Condoms, dental dams, or other barrier methods </li>
</ul>
