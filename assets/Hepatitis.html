          <p> Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, and can be caused by several types of virus. The type of hepatitis that is most likely to be transmitted sexually is the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which will be the focus of this section. About 75,000 people in the U.S. are infected with HBV every year, and about 1.25 million people in the U.S. have chronic HBV infection. </p>

<strong>Transmission</strong>
          
<p>HBV is primarily transmitted through vaginal, anal, and oral sex. It can also be transmitted by sharing needles, from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and from direct exposure to infected fluids (e.g. an accidental needle stick in a lab). </p>

<strong>Symptoms</strong>
<p>
Many people (50%) have no symptoms of HBV. If symptoms do occur, they usually appear between six weeks and six months after infection. They include loss of appetite, fatigue and malaise, nausea and vomiting, headache, fever, abdominal pain, dark urine, and jaundice. 1% of cases may experience sudden liver failure, with severe fatigue, jaundice, and abdominal swelling, requiring immediate medical attention. </p>


<strong>Complications</strong>
<p>Chronic HBV infection can lead to severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis and cancer. There is a 20% mortality rate with chronic HBV. </p>

<strong>Diagnosis</strong>
<p>HBV can be diagnosed with a series of blood tests. Because it can take up to two months for HBV to show up in the blood, you may get a false negative result if you have had any risk of exposure in the past two months. </p>

<strong>Treatment</strong>
<p>Most people with HBV (90-95%) completely recover and clear the infection within two months. For those who develop chronic HBV infection, there are several medications available to fight HBV and prevent liver damage. Infants who get infected at birth are very likely to become chronic HBV carriers unless they receive treatment.</p>

<strong>Prevention</strong>
<p>The following strategies can help reduce the risk of infection:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Abstinence</li>
   <li>Mutual monogamy</li>
   <li>Condoms, dental dams, or other barrier methods </li>
    <li>Avoiding injection drug use, and not sharing needles.</li>
    <li>Avoiding sharing personal items that may have blood on them, such as toothbrushes and razors </li>
</ul>
