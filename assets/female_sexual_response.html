          <p>The sexual response cycle, first proposed by early sexuality researchers Masters and Johnson, is simply a generalization of what happens during sexual arousal and excitement for many females. Describing it in the stages outlined below can be a helpful way to understand what can happen during female sexual response. It is not necessarily linear, and not all females experience the stages one at a time, or in the same order. It is not to be used as a strict guide to “proper” or “healthy” sexual response. </p>

            <li><strong>Phase 1: Excitement</strong>– In response to sexual stimulus, vaginal lubrication may begin. However, some females may not experience vaginal lubrication even when there is excitement and arousal. The clitoris may become engorged, the size and shape of the labia may change, and the inner two-thirds of the vagina may expand.
                </li>
              <li>
<strong>Phase 2: Plateau</strong> – This is the phase between the initial arousal and orgasm. With continued stimulation, the vaginal tissues may continue to swell, the clitoris may withdraw into the clitoral hood, and the labia minora may swell and darken.
                  </li>
              <li>
<strong>Phase 3: Orgasm</strong> – During orgasm, the pelvic muscles around the vagina may contract, the uterus and anal sphincter my contract rhythmically, and muscles may spasm.
Masters and Johnson's descriptions of the sexual response cycle do not include any mention of female ejaculation, but if it occurs, it is likely to be at this stage. It can happen before, during, or after orgasm and may involve “squirting” or just a “surge” of ejaculate.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Phase 4: Resolution</strong> – This is the time immediately following orgasm, where the body begins to return to a “normal” state. Blood flows out of engorged areas.
