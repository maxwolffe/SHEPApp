Oldsite.com is coming soon.<br/><br/>

We are preparing historical web database so anyone can find an old
version of any site on the web.<br/><br/>

Oldsite is made to help anyone to check how old is a site and see it's
progress over time.<br/><br/>
For example, visit our first post about <a href="/spellingcity.html">SpellingCity.com</a> website

Thank you for visiting.<br/><br/>
