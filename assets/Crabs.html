      Pubic lice are tiny parasitic insects feeding on human blood. They can be transmitted through sexual contact as well as through objects like clothing, bedding, and furniture. If symptoms occur, they usually include itching in the genital or anal area, and visible lice or eggs. The lice can be seen with the naked eye or a magnifying glass, usually in the pubic hair. Pubic lice can be cured using over-the-counter shampoo or lotion. All sexual partners should be tested, and cured if infected. Additionally, all clothing, bedding, etc. that may be infected should be thoroughly cleaned. Pubic lice are very contagious, so can be prevented only by avoiding contact with infected people.</p>
