          <li>Sperm are produced in the testes. They complete their maturation  and are stored in the epididymis prior to ejaculation.</li>
          <li>Composition:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>65 - 75% fluid from the seminal vesicles</li>
            <li>25 - 30% prostatic fluid</li>
            <li>2-5% sperm from the testes</li>
            <li>&lt; 1% fluid from the bulbourethral glands</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Seminal vesicle and prostatic fluid help nourish sperm.</li>
          <li>The amount of semen produced during ejaculation varies from a  few drops to 5-6 ml, with an average of 1-2 teaspoons released. </li>
          <li>One ejaculation may contain 40-600 million sperm depending on  the length of time that has passed since the last ejaculation.</li>
          <li>The amount, color, and consistency of semen that is ejaculated,  as well as the force of ejaculation, varies from male to male as well as from  time to time for the same male. </li>
          <li>Semen may appear clotted in males who are under-hydrated.</li>
          <li>Drinking more water, decreasing alcohol and coffee consumption,  and consuming foods like pineapple, honey, and citrus fruits are thought to  'improve' the taste of semen, though many people do not have a problem with the  taste.</li>
        </ul>
