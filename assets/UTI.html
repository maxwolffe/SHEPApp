         Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

      <div id="content">
          <p>A UTI consists of an inflammation of any part of the urinary tract, including the bladder, ureters (tubes that lead from the kidneys to the bladder), and urethra (tube that leads from the bladder out of the body). UTIs are caused by bacteria, often originating from the rectal area, but may come from elsewhere. Although UTIs are not sexually transmitted, they are often related to sexual activity, as many sexual activities can transfer bacteria around. Females are at higher risk than males for UTIs; this is thought to be due to a woman's shorter urethra and the shorter distance between the urethral opening and the anus. Females who use a diaphragm or Leaâ€™s shield may be at higher risk for UTIs.

<strong>Symptoms</strong>
<p>
Symptoms include burning or pain during urination, a frequent urge to urinate even when the bladder is empty, blood or pus in the urine, lower abdominal or back pain, and fever. The last two symptoms may indicate a more serious kidney infection. </p>


<strong>Diagnosis</strong>
<p>UTIs can be diagnosed by culturing a urine sample. </p>

<strong>Treatment</strong>
<p>UTIs are curable with antibiotics. Over-the-counter drugs such as pyridium are also available to relieve the symptoms during treatment. There is no evidence that home remedies such as cranberry juice provide any benefit beyond hydration. </p>
