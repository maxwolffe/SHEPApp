          <p>Female ejaculation has not been extensively studied by the medical community, though in recent years this is changing. What female ejaculate is (it is similar in chemical composition to male prostatic fluid), and what its practical function is (some scientist theorize it may serve to clear bacteria from the urethra) are subjects of much debate. However, there is general consensus that the fluid expelled comes from the paraurethral glands, or Skeneâ€™s glands. What is known for sure is that some females may experience an ejaculation or flow of a liquid that is not vaginal lubrication or urine as part of their sexual response cycle.

Female ejaculation may happen just before, during, or just after orgasm; for some females, it may not even be accompanied by orgasm. Despite the name, it is not always a strong ejaculation or 'squirting' of fluid: some women experience it as a 'wet surge' or 'gush' of fluid. There may be as little as a couple teaspoons or as much as a few cups.

Females who ejaculate may not ejaculate with every orgasm. Many report that they are more likely to ejaculate with G-spot stimulation, and if a female is trying to ejaculate, G-spot stimulation is a good place to start. Stimulate the G-spot with fingers or a curved object, applying firm pressure, until you are intensely turned on and feel a sensation similar to needing to pee (since this makes many females anxious, it is recommended to urinate beforehand to empty the bladder). Keep going past this sensation, and through to orgasm. With time and practice, this may result in a stream or flow of female ejaculate.

Most females can ejaculate. Not all females who ejaculate enjoy doing so. Female ejaculation should be neither a source of anxiety nor a sexual goal, but it can be a fun way to explore your own and/or your partner's body.
