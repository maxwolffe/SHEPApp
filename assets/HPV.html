          <p>HPV is a virus. There are more than 100 types of HPV, which can cause warts on different parts of the body. About 40 types of HPV are sexually transmitted and may infect the anogenital area. Genital HPV infection is very common, with 6 million new infections in the U.S. every year and 20 million people infected at any time. About 75% of sexually active adults will get HPV at some point in their life. Most infections are naturally cleared by the bodyâ€™s immune system, but those that do not clear can cause complications. Some types of HPV are 'low-risk', which cause genital warts. Some are 'high-risk' types, which have no visible symptoms but can lead to cancer over many years. This section discusses high-risk HPV types. </p>

<strong>Transmission</strong>
          
<p>HPV is transmitted by vaginal and anal intercourse, as well as other types of skin-to-skin contact (e.g. genital rubbing, oral sex, and sharing sex toys unprotected). </p>

<strong>Symptoms</strong>
<p>
High-risk HPV types have no visible symptoms, but can lead to cell changes ('dysplasia') and eventually cancer in the cervix, and more rarely in the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, or throat. Cervical cancer is not very common, with only about 12,000 cases diagnosed and 5,000 deaths in the U.S. every year.
</p>

<strong>Diagnosis</strong>
<p>High-risk HPV types are usually not diagnosed directly. Instead, clinicians look for the cell changes that they cause. There are no good screening tests currently available for cell changes in the anus, penis, or throat, so the rest of this section will focus on cervical cell changes.
    </p>
<p>
The Pap test (formerly known as a 'Pap smear') screens for cervical cell changes in females. Samples of cells are taken from different parts of the cervix, then examined under a microscope. If a woman is infected with a high-risk HPV type, the first sign is usually an abnormal Pap test. An 'abnormal' Pap test is a broad category, with various degrees of severity. Depending on the specific Pap test results, a clinician will advise appropriate further testing or treatment. The next step after an abnormal Pap test is usually a colposcopy, a procedure that allows the clinician to look at the cervix with high magnification. During the colposcopy, a biopsy may be taken to further examine the cervical cells.
</p>
          <p>
HPV testing is not done routinely. For females under 30, HPV is so common, and usually harmless and temporary, that testing for it is not clinically helpful. Only females who receive a 'borderline' Pap test result will be tested for HPV, to provide additional information to help with diagnosis. In females over 30, HPV testing may also be done with the Pap test.
</p>

<strong>Treatment</strong>
<p>Depending on the severity of the cervical cell changes, the clinician may adopt a 'wait-and-see' strategy, because the immune system may be able to cure HPV within 2 years and heal the cervix. If appropriate, the clinician will recommend treatment to remove all abnormal cells. The treatment options include cryotherapy (freezing), LEEP (electrosurgical removal), and conization (cone biopsy). </p>

<strong>Prevention</strong>
<p>The following strategies can help reduce the risk of infection:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HPV Vaccine (See Below)</li>
   <li>Abstinence</li>
   <li>Mutual monogamy</li>
   <li>Condoms, dental dams, or other barrier methods </li>
</ul>
          <p> Getting regular Pap tests can identify abnormal cervical cell changes, allowing treatment before the development of cervical cancer. Also, avoiding smoking and leading a healthy lifestyle can keep your immune system strong and help to prevent abnormal cell changes. </p>
        
<strong>HPV Vaccine</strong>
          <p> The HPV vaccine, Gardasil, protects against HPV types 16 and 18 (which cause 70% of cervical cancer) and 6 and 11 (which cause 90% of genital warts). It is most effective when given before a person becomes sexually active. In clinical trials, the vaccine was 99% effective in preventing cervical dysplasia and 93% effective in preventing genital warts among females who were not yet sexually active. Among females who were already sexually active (and may have already been exposed to HPV), the vaccine was only 40% effective in preventing cervical dysplasia and 68% effective in preventing genital warts. The vaccine has been officially approved for females and males ages 9-26. It is very important for vaccinated females to still get Pap tests regularly, as they will not be protected against the HPV types that cause 30% of cervical cancer.
              </p>
<p>
A second HPV vaccine, Cervarix, has been approved for use in females. Cervarix protects against HPV types 16 and 18 only. This vaccine is available to females ages 9 to 25 years of age. Cervarix is administered in 3 shots over a 6 month period of time. While Cervarix has been found to be up to 99% effective in preventing the 2 main HPV types that lead to cervical cancer, it is only effective for a little more than 4 years and may need to be re-administered to provide continued protection. </p>
