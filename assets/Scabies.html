          <p>Scabies is caused by a tiny mite. It can be transmitted through sexual contact, as well as through prolonged household contact or through objects such as clothing, bedding, or furniture. The symptoms include itching due to fecal matter (often worse at night), visible mite burrows in the skin, or other lesions. These are often found in the genital area, at joints (e.g. armpits, elbows, knees), on the torso, or on the fingers and toes. A person infected with scabies may be unaware for several weeks but are still able to transmit scabies to others. Scabies can be diagnosed with a variety of clinical observations and tests. Scabies can be cured through prescription lotion or pills. All sexual partners and household members should be tested, and treated if appropriate. The patient should avoid sexual contact until all treatment has been completed. Additionally, all clothing, bedding, etc. that may be infected should be thoroughly cleaned. Scabies is very contagious, so can be prevented only by avoiding contact with infected people or items.</p>
